# Library Management System

A simple library management system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add, view, and manage books in a library. Users can mark books as read or unread and remove them from the list.

## Features

- **Add a Book**: Users can add new books to the library with details such as title, author, number of pages, and whether the book has been read.
- **View Books**: A table displays all the books currently in the library.
- **Mark as Read**: Users can mark books as read or unread.
- **Remove Books**: Users can remove books from the library.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet for styling the application.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for managing the library.
